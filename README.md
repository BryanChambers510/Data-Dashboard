# Data-Dashboard
This is a small scale "Front End" to "Back End" development project that analyzes world bank data about rural populations, creates visualizations, and publishes the results on a website. 
The main files/folders in this project are the 'data' folder. This folder contains four csv files that have information about rural populations and the amount of arable or forested land in most of the worlds countries. The 'wrangle_data' file is located in the 'wrangling_scripts' folder and this file contains code written in Python that cleans the data sets from the 'data' folder and creates visualizations of the data. The 'requirements' folder contains all of the necessary library packages to perform the tasks needed such as pandas, numpy, flask, etc. The 'routes.py' folder is located in the myappfolder and this file loads the data using a data wrangling function from 'wrangle_data.py' and converts 'plotly' visualizations to JSON for Javascript to be sent to the html template 'index.html'. This is made possible through 'flask' which is a 'web microframework' package. The 'index.html' is the 'front end' part of the project where the and html template is used to take the visualizations id's and JSON script to create the website. The 'instructions' file explains what commands to enter in the terminal to get the app to run. The website was deployed through a third party web application development company called 'Heroku'. To see the website go to https://worldbankstats4.herokuapp.com/.
